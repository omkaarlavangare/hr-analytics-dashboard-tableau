# Employee Attrition Analysis: An Interactive Tableau Dashboard
## Description:

This project presents a comprehensive and interactive Tableau dashboard that analyses employee attrition and the factors influencing it. The visualisation explores the intricate relationships between various employment factors and employee attrition, providing actionable insights for HR professionals and decision-makers.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors) used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It offers detailed information on employee demographics, roles, and work conditions, making it ideal for studying attrition patterns.

## Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to identify and understand the employment factors that most significantly impact employee attrition. Through the interactive dashboard, we aim to answer key questions such as:

Which job roles exhibit higher rates of attrition?
How does marital status influence employee retention?
Is salary the dominant factor in attrition, or do other variables play a critical role?
By addressing these questions, this analysis seeks to provide deeper insights into the underlying causes of attrition and help organizations design better retention strategies.

## Introduction
This visualization leverages a variety of employment parameters to create a holistic view of attrition trends. The key factors considered in this analysis include:

- Education Level
- Job Role
- Marital Status
- Gender
- Years of Service at the Company
- Department
- Salary

To enhance the analysis and enable meaningful visualizations, additional derived fields were created, including:

- Salary Brackets
- Age Brackets
- Attrition Count
- Attrition Rate
- Active Employees

These enhancements ensure the visualizations are more insightful and relevant to understanding attrition dynamics.

## Insights

Analysing the employee attrition dataset has uncovered several critical insights:
1.	Salary and Attrition:
Salary emerges as a key factor influencing attrition. The salary range of $2,000–$5,000 shows the highest rate of employee attrition.

2.	Impact of Marital Status:
Marital status significantly correlates with attrition. Employees who are single exhibit the highest attrition rates, followed by married and divorced individuals.

3.	Education Fields and Attrition:
Certain education fields are more prone to attrition, with Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing showing the highest rates of employee attrition.

4.	Job Roles Driving Attrition:
Specific job roles also experience higher attrition. The role of Laboratory Technician demonstrates the highest attrition among all roles.

5.	Departmental Trends in Attrition:
Departmental analysis reveals that the Sales department has the highest attrition rate, followed by Human Resources and Research & Development.

6.	Years of Service and Attrition:
Tenure significantly impacts attrition patterns:
  * Employees with 0–3 years of service are the most likely to leave.
  * A noticeable spike in attrition is observed among employees with 10 years of service.

7.	Gender and Attrition:
Gender analysis indicates that males contribute more to attrition rates compared to females.

## Future Work

This analysis has potential for further exploration using additional factors available in the dataset, such as:

- Distance from Home: Investigating how commute times affect employee retention.
- Job Satisfaction Scores: Understanding the relationship between employee satisfaction and attrition.

Incorporating these variables can create a more robust and comprehensive visualization, offering deeper insights into employee behavior and attrition trends.
